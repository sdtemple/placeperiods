Faculty Advisor: Stephen Fickas

Description of project:
I will be developing an artificial neural network that takes as input text files without periods
and returns as output the same text files, but with periods in the grammatically correct position.
This project introduces me to natural language processing and machine learning topics, and it requires
me to gain facility with a variety of popular machine learning and NLP packages in python.

Requirements for completion of credits, brief description of duties:

Content Readings
	Deep Learning with Python
	Applied Text Analysis with Python
	Natural Language Processing with Python Cookbook
	Online articles about NLP and machine learning
	Other textbooks about NLP and machine learning

Gain facility with the following packages
	gensim
	word2vec
	keras
	theano
	tensorflow
	sklearn
	pandas
	numpy
	nltk

Be able to explain the following CS concepts
	Skip-gram models
	Vectorized representation of text
	Artificial neural network
	Backpropagation and learning algorithms
	Unsupervised learning versus supervised learning
	Network topology of a neural network
	What the adjective 'deep' in deep learning means
	Broad overview of relevant topics in and history of NLP

Develop an artificial neural network to place periods where they belong in a sentence
Create .py files to preprocess text data from Wiki dumps and other sources (YouTube?)
Run jobs on GPU to teach the artificial neural network (talapas)
Meet weekly or biweekly with faculty advisor to explain my work

Requirements for completion of course, grading will be based on the following criteria:

Student's ability to explain
	Neural networks
	The network topology
	The backpropagation algorithm
	The code in the .py files

Student's progress at
	Solving the Place the Period problem
	Collecting and preprocessing data to use in teaching the neural network
	Training the the neural network on talapas GPU

Attendance
	Student puts in 10-20 hours per week on the project (Student putting in ~5 hours during winter term)

(Optional)
	If the student creates a good neural network to solve the Place the Period problem, 
	the student could write a short paper about it. The faculty advisor will grade the
	paper based on clarity, quality and originality.

(Optional)
	Student could be tasked with other projects if the student finishes the current one
